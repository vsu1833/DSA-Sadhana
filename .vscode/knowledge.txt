// Note:
// to_string(num) converts a number (e.g., int, long) to its string form.
// If num is negative, the '-' sign is included in the string, increasing the length by 1.
// To get the correct digit count, use abs(num) before converting to string.
// Example: int k = to_string(abs(num)).length();


/*
An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is an integer such that the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits is equal to the number itself.
For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because:
1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153

/*
 Both cin and getline are used to read input in C++, but they behave differently:

cin
Reads input up to the first whitespace (space, tab, or newline).
Example:
If you enter hello world, cin >> s; will only store hello in s.
getline
Reads an entire line of input, including spaces, until a newline character is found.
Example:
If you enter hello world, getline(cin, s); will store hello world in s
